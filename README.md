## Description

This e-commerce backend application serves as a hands-on project for learning Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using Sequelize. It provides an API for managing an e-commerce site's products, categories, and tags. The application is built with Express.js and interfaces with a MySQL database, facilitating the performance of CRUD operations via RESTful endpoints.

Throughout the development process, Insomnia REST Client was utilized extensively to test API routes, ensuring that the backend functionality met the required specifications for handling web requests effectively.

By leveraging the ORM approach, this project demonstrates the efficient management of database schemas and streamlines the process of querying and manipulating data in a relational database.
